Features

===

--> we can easily remove item to click on checkbox.

--> we can easily add item to write list name and click on next to button.

--> we can also create own list.

   for example,
   
    Firstly, try localhost:3000/cloths. we have to add some thing into list that have to buy a cloths.
    
    Secondly, try localhost:3000/homemad. we have to add some homemad thing name into list.
    
    At now, if we want to check that whcih cloths do we require , search try localhost:3000/cloths . It will give you list that we added in the list. also we can remove after bought.then rest of the list will automatically saved.
    
--> in this todo list, we have also added lodash. That is, try localhost:3000/CLOTHS == localhost:3000/Cloths == localhost:3000/cloths. That means, not case sensitive.
